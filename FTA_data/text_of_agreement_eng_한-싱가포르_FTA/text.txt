A4.9:A  1. Originating materials from the territory of a Party incorporated in the production of a good in the territory of the other Party, shall be considered to originate in the territory of the other Party.  2. For the purpose of establishing that a good is originating, the producer of a good may accumulate one’s production with the production, in the territory of one or both of the Parties by one or more producers, of materials incorporated in the production of the good, so that the production of those materials is considered as done by that producer, provided that the good complies with the criteria set out in Article 4.2.   A4.10:DM 
 1. A good that does not undergo a change in tariff classification pursuant to Annex 4A shall be considered as originating if:  (a)  the value of all non-originating materials used in its production that do not undergo the required change in tariff classification does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the customs value of the good; and (b)  the good meets all other applicable criteria set forth in this Chapter for qualifying as an originating good.

Paragraph 1 shall not apply to:  (a) a non-originating material used in the production of a good provided for in Chapters 1 through 14 of the Harmonized System; and (b) a non-originating material used in the production of a good provided for in Chapters 15 through 24 of the Harmonized System unless the non-originating material is provided for in a different subheading from that of the good for which the origin is being determined under this Article.  3. A good provided for in Chapters 50 through 63 of the Harmonized System that is not an originating good, because certain fibres or yarns used in the production of the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A, shall nonetheless be considered as originating if the total weight of all such fibres or yarns in that component is not more than eight (8) per cent of the total weight of that component.   A4.11:FGM  1. The determination of whether fungible goods or materials are originating goods shall be made either by physical segregation of each good or material or through the use of any of the inventory management method, such as averaging, last-in, first-out, or first in, first-out, recognised in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of a Party in 
which the production is performed or otherwise accepted by the Party in which the production is performed.  2. Once a particular inventory management method is selected under paragraph 1, that method shall continue to be used for those fungible goods or materials throughout the fiscal year of the person that selected the inventory management method.   A4.12:A,SPT  1. Accessories, spare parts, or tools, delivered with a good that form part of standard accessories, spare parts or tools of the good, shall be considered as originating if the good is an originating good, and shall be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A, provided that:  (a) the accessories, spare parts or tools are not invoiced separately from the good; and (b) the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts or tools are customary for the good.    2.  If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of the accessories, spare parts or tools shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.   A4.13:PMCRS   Packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale shall, if classified with the good, be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A, and, if the good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of such packaging materials and containers shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good.  
 A4.14:PMCS   Packing materials and containers in which a good is packed for shipment shall be disregarded in determining whether:   (a) the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A; and (b) the good satisfies a regional value content requirement.   A4.15:DC   A good shall not be considered to be an originating good of a Party by reason of having undergone production that satisfies the requirements of Article 4.2, if, subsequent to that production:  (a)  the good is not transported directly to the territory of the other Party; or (b)  where the good is shipped through or transshipped in the territory of a country that is not a Party under this Agreement, the importer has failed to meet the requirements stipulated in paragraph (c) of Article 5.9.    A4.16:N-QO     Notwithstanding any provision in this Chapter, a good shall not be considered to have satisfied the requirements for an originating good in Article 4.2 merely by reason of going through certain operations or processes including, inter alia, the following :  (a)  operations to ensure the preservation of products in good condition during transport and storage (such as drying, freezing, keeping in brine) and other similar operations; (b)  changes of packaging and breaking up and assembly of packages; (c) affixing marks, labels and other like distinguishing signs on products or their packaging; (d)  disassembly; (e)  testing or calibrations;

Each Party shall exchange the following information of their contact points: name, address, telephone number and email address by date of the entry into force of the Agreement, or at any time thereafter upon agreement of the Parties.    
CHAPTER 6 TRADE REMEDIES   A6.1:D  For the purposes of this Chapter:  domestic industry means the producers as a whole of the like or directly competitive products operating within the territory of a Party, or those whose collective output of the like or directly competitive products constitute a major proportion of the total domestic production of those products;  global safeguard measure means a measure applied under Article XIX of  GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards;  serious injury means a significant overall impairment in the position of a domestic industry;  substantial cause means a cause which is important and not less than any other cause; and  threat of serious injury means serious injury that, on the basis of facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility, is clearly imminent.   Article 6.2 : Anti-Dumping Measures   1.   The Parties maintain their rights and obligations under Article VI of  GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of  GATT 1994 (“WTO Agreement on Anti-dumping”).  2.  Anti-dumping actions taken pursuant to Articles VI of  GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Anti-dumping shall not be subject to Chapter 20 (Dispute Settlement).  3.  Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Parties shall observe the following practices in anti-dumping cases between them in order to enhance transparency in the 
implementation of the WTO Anti-dumping Agreement:  (a) when anti-dumping margins are established on the weighted average basis, all individual margins, whether positive or negative, should be counted toward the average; and (b) if a decision is taken to impose an anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 9.1 of the WTO Agreement on Anti-dumping, the Party taking such a decision, should apply the ‘lesser duty’ rule, by imposing a duty which is less than the dumping margin where such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry.   A6.3:CM  1.   The Parties maintain their rights and obligations under Article VI of  GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.  2.  Countervailing measures taken pursuant to Article VI of  GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures shall not be subject to Chapter 20 (Dispute Settlement).   Article 6.4 : Bilateral Safeguard Measures   1.  Subject to paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, if, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, an originating good of the other Party is being imported into the territory of a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to domestic production, and under such conditions that the imports of such originating good from the other Party constitute a substantial cause of serious injury or threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, such Party may:  (a) suspend  further reduction of any rate of customs duty provided for under this Agreement for such originating good; or (b) increase the rate of customs duty on  such originating good to a level not to exceed the lesser of: (i)  the most-favoured-nation (“MFN”) applied rate of duty on the good in 
effect at the time the action is taken; and (ii)  the MFN applied rate of duty on the good in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement.   2. A Party shall take a measure only following an investigation by that Party’s competent authorities in accordance with Article 3 and paragraph 2 of Article 4 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. To this end, Article 3 and paragraph 2 of Article 4 of the WTO Agreement on Safeguards are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement, mutatis mutandis. The investigation shall in all cases be completed within one year following its date of initiation.  3. A Party shall notify the other Party in writing upon initiation of an investigation provided for in paragraph 2 and shall consult with the other Party as far in advance of taking any such measure as practicable, with a view to reviewing the information arising from the investigation, exchanging views on the measure and reaching an agreement on compensation as set out in paragraph 8. If a Party takes a provisional measure pursuant to paragraph 7, the Party shall also notify the other Party prior to taking such measure, and shall initiate consultations with the other Party immediately after such measure is taken.  4. No measure may be maintained:  (a) except to the extent and for such period of time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment; or (b) for a period exceeding two (2) years; except that the period may be extended by up to two (2) years if the competent authorities determine, in conformity with the procedures set out in paragraphs 1 through 3, that the measure continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate adjustment and that there is evidence that the industry is adjusting.  5. Where the expected duration of the measure is over one year, the Party applying such measure shall progressively liberalise it at regular intervals during the period of application.  6. Upon the termination of the measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate which would have been in effect but for the measure.  
7. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a Party may take a measure described in paragraph 1 on a provisional basis pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports from the other Party have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and such imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry.  The duration of such provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time the requirements of paragraph 2 shall be met.  Any tariff increases shall be promptly refunded if the investigation provided for in paragraph 2 does not result in a finding that the requirements of paragraph 1 are met.  The duration of any provisional measure shall be counted as part of the period described in paragraph 4.  8.   The Party applying a measure described in paragraph 1 shall provide to the other Party mutually agreed trade liberalising compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the measure. If the Parties are unable to agree on compensation within thirty (30) days in the consultations under paragraph 3, the Party against whose originating good the measure is applied may take action with respect to originating goods of the other Party that has trade effects substantially equivalent to the measure.  The Party taking such action shall apply the action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent effects, and in any event, only while the measure under paragraph 1 is being applied.   Article 6.5 : Global Safeguard Measures  1.   The Parties maintain their rights and obligations under Article XIX of GATT 1994 and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.  2.   Actions taken pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be subject to Chapter 20 (Dispute Settlement).   CHAPTER7 SANITARYANDPHYTOSANITARYMEASURES   
A7.1:SAPM  1. The Parties shall not apply their sanitary and phytosanitary measures in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.  2. The Parties shall ensure that any sanitary and phytosanitary measure is applied only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, is based on scientific principles and is not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence.  3.  The principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be applied in accordance with the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures which is hereby incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.  4. To provide a means of consultation and exchange of information between the Parties on sanitary and phytosanitary matters and enable the response to queries from one Party to the other within a reasonable time, the Parties shall maintain and communicate through the following contact points:  (a) for Korea, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry; and (b) for Singapore, Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority.                                                  The communications and essential information exchanged between the Parties shall be in the English language. Particulars relating to the contact points shall be exchanged at the earliest possible, after the entry into force of this Agreement. The Parties understand that the communications between the Parties can be made via fax, e-mail or any other means agreed to by the Parties. 
  CHAPTER8 TECHNICAL BARRIERS TO TRADE AND MUTUAL RECOGNITION   A8.1:O   The objectives of this Chapter are to increase and facilitate trade between the Parties through:  (a) the full implementation of the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade ( “WTO TBT Agreement”); (b) enhancing bilateral co-operation by deepening their mutual understanding and awareness of their respective standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment systems; and (c) creating and improving  the business climate so as to increase business opportunities.   A8.2: SAM  1. This Chapter applies to standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures that may directly or indirectly affect trade in goods between the Parties and/or assessments of manufacturers or manufacturing processes.  2. The Parties shall intensify their joint work in the field of standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures and/or assessments of manufacturers or manufacturing processes, with a view to facilitating market access. In particular, the Parties shall seek to identify initiatives that are appropriate for particular issues or sectors. Such initiatives may include co-operation on regulatory issues, such as, alignment to international standards, reliance on supplier’s declaration of conformity, and use of accreditations to qualify conformity assessment bodies.  3. In this respect, the Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exists to facilitate the acceptance of conformity assessment results, including:  
(a) agreements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures with respect to specified regulations conducted by bodies located in the territory of the other Party; (b) accreditation procedures for qualifying conformity assessment bodies; (c) government designation of conformity assessment bodies;   (d)  recognition by a Party of the results of conformity assessments performed in the other Party’s territory; (e)  voluntary arrangements between conformity assessment bodies from each Party’s territory; and (f) the importing Party’s acceptance of a supplier’s declaration of conformity.

Any such arrangements shall be formalised in a Sectoral Annex, as appropriate.  4. In accordance with Article 2.4 of the WTO TBT Agreement, where technical regulations are required and relevant international standards exist or their completion is imminent, the Parties shall use them, or the relevant parts of such standards, as a basis for their Mandatory Requirements, except when such international standards or relevant parts of such standards would be an ineffective or inappropriate means for the legitimate objectives pursued, for instance, as a result of fundamental climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems.    5. In determining whether an international standard, guide, or recommendation within the meaning of Articles 2 and 5, and Annex 3 of the WTO TBT Agreement exists, each Party shall apply the principles set out in “Section IX (Decision of the Committee on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2 and 5, and Annex 3 of the Agreement) in the Decisions and Recommendations adopted by the Committee since 1 January 1995”, G/TBT/1/Rev.8, 23 May 2002 and its Revision issued by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.   6.

The following procedures shall apply to the registration of a CAB:  (a) each Party  shall make a proposal that a CAB of that Party designated by its Designating Authority be registered under this Article, by presenting its proposal in writing, supported by the necessary documents, to the other Party  and the TBT Joint Committee established in accordance with Article 8.7 (“TBT Joint Committee”);  (b) the other  Party shall consider whether the proposed CAB complies with the stipulated and mandatory requirements specified in the relevant Sectoral Annex and communicate, to the  Party making the proposal and the TBT Joint Committee in writing,  the other Party’s position regarding the registration of that CAB along with estimated date of registration within ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the proposal referred to in paragraph (a).  In such consideration, such other Party should assume that the proposed CAB complies with the aforementioned criteria.  The TBT Joint Committee shall, within ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the position of such other Party, decide whether to register the proposed CAB.   Following the TBT Joint Committee’s decision, a  Party’s Designating Authority shall inform the other  Party about the date of registration of the proposed CAB within seven (7) days from the date of receipt of the TBT Joint Committee’s decision; and  (c) In the event that the TBT Joint Committee cannot decide to register the proposed CAB, the TBT Joint Committee may decide to conduct joint verification with or request the proposing Party to conduct a verification of the proposed CAB with the prior consent of the CAB. After the completion of such verification, the TBT Joint Committee may reconsider the proposal.   8. The proposing Party shall provide the following information in its proposal for registration of a CAB and keep such information up-to-date:  (a) the name and address of the CAB;   (b) the products or processes the CAB is designated to assess;  (c) the conformity assessment procedures the CAB is designated to conduct; and  
(d) the designation procedure and necessary information used to determine the compliance of the CAB with the stipulated requirements for designation.  9. Each Party shall ensure that its Designating Authority withdraws the designation of its CAB registered by the Designating Authority of the other Party when its Party’s Designating Authority considers that the CAB no longer complies with the stipulated and mandatory requirements of the other Party set out in the relevant Sectoral Annex.  The withdrawal of the designation shall be notified in writing to the other Party and the TBT Joint Committee. Each Party shall terminate the registration of a CAB when the Designating Authority of the other  Party withdraws the designation of its CAB.  The date of termination of registration of the CAB shall be the date of receipt of notification for withdrawal from the other Party.  10. Each Party shall propose the termination of the registration of its CAB when that Party considers that the CAB no longer complies with the stipulated requirements and mandatory requirements of that Party specified in the relevant Sectoral Annex.  Proposal for terminating the registration of that CAB shall be made to the TBT Joint Committee and the other Party in writing.  The registration of that CAB shall be terminated upon receipt by the Parties of the decision of the TBT Joint Committee.  11.  In the case of a registration of a new CAB, the other Party shall accept the results of conformity assessment procedures conducted by that CAB from the date of the registration.  In the event that the registration of a CAB is terminated, the other Party shall accept the results of the conformity assessment procedures conducted by that CAB prior to the termination, without prejudice to paragraphs 18 and 19.   12.  Each Party shall notify the other Party of any scheduled changes concerning its designated CABs.   13.  The Parties shall notify the general public of the registration of CABs, on a sector-by-sector basis.   Verification and Monitoring of Conformity Assessment Bodies  14.  Each Party shall ensure that its Designating Authority:  (a) shall undertake through appropriate means such as audits, inspections or 
monitoring, that the registered CABs designated by the Party  fulfill the stipulated and mandatory requirements set out in the Sectoral Annex.  When applying the stipulated requirements for designation of the CABs, the Designating Authority of a Party should take into account the bodies’ understanding of and experience relevant to the mandatory requirements of the other Party;  (b) shall monitor and verify that the registered CABs designated by a Party  maintain the necessary technical competence to demonstrate the conformity of a product with the standards, and/or specifications to meet the mandatory requirements of the other Party. This may include participation in appropriate proficiency-testing programmes and other comparative reviews such as mutual recognition agreements between non-governmental entities, so that confidence in their technical competence to undertake the required conformity assessment is maintained; and (c) shall exchange information concerning the procedures such as accreditation systems used to designate CABs and to ensure that the registered CABs designated by a Party are technically competent and comply with the relevant stipulated requirements.  15.  When in doubt, a Party may request other designating Party in writing whether or not a registered CAB complies with the stipulated requirements for that Party’s designation as set out in the mandatory requirements in the Sectoral Annex and/or request for a verification of the CAB to be conducted in accordance with that Party’s mandatory requirements.  16. A Party may, with the prior consent of the other Party, participate at its own expense, in the verification process of the CAB conducted by the Designating Authority of the other Party, provided that there is prior consent of such CABs, in order to maintain a continuing understanding of that other Party’s procedures for verification.  17.  Each Party shall encourage its registered CABs to co-operate with the CABs of the other Party.  Suspension and Lifting the Suspension of Designation of Conformity Assessment Bodies  18.  In case of suspension of the designation of a registered CAB, the Party, shall 
immediately notify the other Party and the TBT Joint Committee of the suspension.  The registration of that CAB shall be suspended from the date of receipt of the decision of the TBT Joint Committee.  The other Party shall accept the results of the conformity assessment procedures conducted by that CAB prior to the suspension of the designation.  19.  In the case of lifting of suspension of the designation of a registered CAB, the Party shall immediately notify the other Party and the TBT Joint Committee of the lifting of suspension.  The lifting of suspension of the registration of that CAB shall be effective from the date of the receipt of the decision of the TBT Joint Committee.  The other Party shall accept the results of the conformity assessment procedures conducted by that CAB from the date of lifting of the suspension of the registration.   Challenge  20. Each Party shall have the right to challenge a registered CAB’s technical competence and compliance with the relevant stipulated requirements specified in the Sectoral Annex. This right shall be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and when supported by relevant expert analysis and/or evidence. A Party shall exercise this right by notifying the other Party and the TBT Joint Committee in writing.   21.

A Party may terminate a Sectoral Annex in its entirety by giving the other Party six (6) months’ advance notice in writing unless otherwise stated in the relevant Sectoral Annex. However, a Party shall continue to accept the results of conformity assessment for the duration of the six-month notice period.  5. Where urgent problems of safety, health, consumer or environment protection or 
national security arise or threaten to arise for a Party, that Party may suspend the operation of any Sectoral Annex, in whole or in part, immediately.  In such a case, the Party shall immediately advise the other Party of the nature of the urgent problem, the products covered and the objective and rationale of the suspension.   6.

Such commitments shall be inscribed in a Party’s Schedule of specific commitments in Annex 9C.   A9.8:FL  1.    The Parties will, through future negotiations, to be scheduled pursuant to the Article 22.1, further deepen liberalisation with a view to reaching the reduction or elimination of the remaining restrictions scheduled in conformity with Article 9.6 and to adding additional commitments to Article 9.7, on a mutually advantageous basis and at ensuring an overall balance of rights and obligations.   2.  If a Party makes any further liberalisation of the remaining restrictions scheduled in conformity with Article 9.6 or any additional commitments scheduled in conformity with Article 9.7 by an agreement with a non-Party, it shall afford adequate opportunity to the other Party to negotiate treatment granted therein on a mutually advantageous basis and with a view to securing an overall balance of rights and obligations.

A9.10:R  1.     For the purposes of the fulfillment of, in whole or in part, its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of services suppliers, and subject to the requirements in paragraph 3, a Party may recognise the education or experience obtained, requirements met, or licenses or certifications granted in the other Party.  Such recognition, which may be achieved through harmonisation or otherwise, may be based upon an agreement or arrangement between the Parties, or may be accorded autonomously.  2.    A Party that is a party to an agreement or arrangement of the type referred to in paragraph 1, whether existing or future, shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party, if the other Party is interested, to negotiate its accession to such an agreement or arrangement or to negotiate comparable ones with it. Where a Party accords recognition autonomously, it shall afford adequate opportunity for the other Party to demonstrate that education, experience, licences, or certifications obtained or requirements met in that other Party's territory should be recognised.   3.  A Party shall not accord recognition in a manner which would constitute a means of discrimination between countries in the application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or certification of services suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in services.   4.  Annex 9D applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to the licensing or certification of professional service providers.  
 A9.11:DR  1. Each Party shall ensure that all measures of general application affecting trade in services are administered in a reasonable, objective and impartial manner.  2. Each Party shall maintain or institute as soon as practicable judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, at the request of an affected service supplier of the other Party, for the prompt review of, and where justified, appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions affecting trade in services.  Where such procedures are not independent of the agency entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, the Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.  3. Paragraph 2 shall not be construed to require a Party to institute such tribunals or procedures where this would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its legal system.  4.  Where authorisation is required for the supply of a service, the competent authorities of a Party shall, within a reasonable period of time after the submission of an application considered complete under domestic laws and regulations, inform the applicant of the decision concerning the application.  At the request of the applicant, the competent authorities of the Party shall provide, without undue delay, information concerning the status of the application.  5.  With the objective of ensuring that measures relating to qualification requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements do not constitute unnecessary barriers to trade in services, the Parties shall jointly review theresults of the negotiations on disciplines on these measures, pursuant to Article VI.4 of GATS, with a view to their incorporation into this Agreement.  The Parties note that such disciplines aim to ensure that such requirements are inter alia:  (a) based on objective and transparent criteria, such as competence and the ability to supply the service; (b) not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service;  (c) in the case of licensing procedures, not in themselves a restriction on the supply of the service. 
 6. Pending the incorporation of disciplines pursuant to pararaph 5, a Party shall not apply licensing and qualification requirements and technical standards that nullify or impair its obligations under this Chapter in a manner which:  (a) does not comply with the criteria outlined in paragraphs 5(a), (b) or (c); and  (b) could not reasonably have been expected of that Party at the time the obligations were undertaken.  7. In determining whether a Party is in conformity with its obligations under paragraph 6, account shall be taken of international standards of relevant international organisations applied by that Party.    A9.12:DB   Subject to prior notification and consultation in accordance with Article 19.3  and Article 20.4, a Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to a service provider of the other Party where the Party establishes that the service is being provided by an enterprise that is owned or controlled by persons of a non-Party and that has no substantive business operations in the territory of the other Party.   A9.13:MESS  1.  Each Party shall ensure that any monopoly supplier of a service in its territory does not, in the supply of the monopoly service in the relevant market, act in a manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations under Articles 9.3 and 9.5.   2.  Where a Party's monopoly supplier competes, either directly or through an affiliated company, in the supply of a service outside the scope of its monopoly rights and which is subject to that Party's obligations under Articles 9.3 and 9.5, the Party shall ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.                                               The term “relevant international organisations” refers to international bodies whose membership is open to relevant bodies of both Parties. 
 3.  If a Party has reason to believe that a monopoly supplier of a service of the other Party is acting in a manner inconsistent with paragraph 1 or 2, it may request the other Party establishing, maintaining or authorising such supplier to provide specific information concerning the relevant operations in its territory.   4.  The provisions of this Article shall also apply to cases of exclusive service suppliers, where a Party, formally or in effect, (a) authorises or establishes a small number of service suppliers and (b) substantially prevents competition among those suppliers in its territory.   A9.14:MAR  1.  By giving three (3) months of written notification to the other Party, a Party may modify or add to its non-conforming measures as set out in Annex 9A and add new sectors, sub-sectors or activities to its reservations set out in Annex 9B. At the request of the other Party, it shall hold consultations with a view to reaching agreement on any necessary adjustment required to maintain the overall balance of commitments undertaken by each Party under this Agreement. If agreement is not reached between the Parties on any necessary adjustment, the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with Chapter 20 (Dispute Settlement).   2.  Paragraph 1 shall not be construed to prejudice the right of both Parties to maintain any existing measure or adopt new measures consistent with the reservations set out in Annexes 9A and 9B.  3.   Within two (2) years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, a Party may modify or add to its reservations as set out in Annex 9A in respect of any measure inconsistent with Article 9.5 so long as such a measure has been maintained by that Party before the date of the signature of this Agreement.    A9.15:PT  1. Subject to its reservations pursuant to Article 9.6 and except under the circumstances envisaged in Article 9.16, a Party shall not apply restrictions on 
international transfers and payments for current transactions.   2.  Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties as members of the International Monetary Fund under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with the Articles of Agreement, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital transactions inconsistently with its obligations under this Chapter regarding such transactions, except under Article 9.16, or at request of the Fund.    A9.16:B--PE  1. Where a Party is in serious balance of payments and external financial difficulties or threat thereof, it may, in accordance with Articles XI and XII of GATS adopt or maintain restrictions on trade in services on which it has obligations, including on payments or transfers for transactions related to such commitments. Articles XI and XII of GATS is hereby incorporated into and made part of this Agreement.   2.  The Party introducing a measure under this Article shall promptly notify the other Party.

I would be grateful if you would confirm that the understanding of my Government as stated above is shared by your Government and that this understanding shall be treated as an integral part of the Agreement.  Sincerely,              ________________             [Name of Singapore’s Representative]             [Title]

LIM Hng Kiang   I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated [Date], which reads as follows:  “I have the honour to refer to the Free Trade Agreement between the government of the Republic of Korea and the government of the Republic of Singapore (“the Agreement”) signed in Seoul on August 4, 2005  Resulting from the above Agreement, I have the honour of confirming the understanding of both Parties in relation to Chapter 9 (Cross-border Trade in Services) of the Agreement, that at the first review meeting of the Agreement provided under Article 22.1, the two Parties shall discuss the applicability of Article 9.5 of the Agreement to measures by a Party affecting the supply of a service in its territory by investors of the other Party or investment of investors of the other Party.

Forms that an investment may take include, but are not limited to:                                               For clarification, investment does not mean, (a) claims to money that arise solely from:  (i)  commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an enterprise in the territory of the other Party, (ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial transaction, such as trade financing, and (b) an order entered in a judicial or administrative action  and do not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a) to (h).   For the purpose of this Chapter, “loans and other debt instruments” described in paragraph (c) and “claims to money and claims to any performance under contract” described in paragraph (f) of Article 10.1 refer to assets which relate to a business activity and do not refer to assets which are of a personal nature, unrelated to any business activity.

SB-I  A10.2:SC  1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:  (a) investors of the other Party;  (b)  investments of investors of the other Party in the territory of a Party; and (c) with respect to Articles 10.7 and 10.18, all the investments in the territory of the Party.  2. This Chapter applies to the existing investments at the date of the entry into force of this Agreement, as well as to the investments made or acquired after this date.  3. For the purposes of this Chapter, measures adopted or maintained by a Party mean measures adopted or maintained by central or local governments and authorities or by non-governmental bodies in the exercise of any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority delegated by central or local governments and authorities.  4. This Chapter does not apply to claims arising out of events which occurred, or claims which had been raised, prior to the entry into force of this Agreement.   5. This Chapter does not apply to services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority (such as law enforcement, correctional services, income security or insurance, social security or insurance, social welfare, public education, public training, health, and child care), provided that such services are supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers.   A10.3:ROC                                               This provision will be applied only when  the investment of the investor of the Party suffers loss through the imposition of performance requirements to an investment of investor of a non-Party .  For the purpose of Article 10.11, both Parties agree that social security, public retirement or compulsory savings schemes run by the government, such as the Central Provident Fund of Singapore, fall  within the scope of  “services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority”. 
1. In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter in this Agreement, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.   2. The requirement by a Party that a service provider of the other Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition of providing a service into its territory does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to the provision of that cross-border service. This Chapter applies to that Party's treatment of the posted bond or financial security.  3. This Chapter does not apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party to the extent that they are covered by Chapter 12 (Financial Services) unless specified otherwise therein.   A10.4:NT  1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.   2. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.  3. The treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a local government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that local government to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part, including itself.   A10.5:MST  1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of the other Party treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. 
 2. The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security” in paragraph 1 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens and do not create additional substantive rights.  (a) The obligation to provide "fair and equitable treatment" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings. (b)  The obligation to provide "full protection and security" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law. (c) The "customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens" refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.  3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.   A10.6:AJAP  Each Party shall within its territory accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than the treatment which it accords in like circumstances to its own investors, with respect to access to its courts of justice and administrative tribunals and agencies in all degrees of jurisdiction both in pursuit and in defence of such investors’ rights.   A10.7:PR  1. Neither Party may impose or enforce any of the following requirements, or enforce any commitment or undertaking, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory:   
(a) to export a given level or percentage of goods or services; (b) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content; (c) to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from persons in its territory; (d) to purchase, use or accord a preference to services provided in its territory, or to purchase services from persons in its territory; (e) to relate the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with such investment;  (f) to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that such investment  produces or provides by relating such sales to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings; (g) to transfer technology, a production process or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory, except when the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced by a court, administrative tribunal or competition authority to remedy an alleged violation of competition law or to act in a manner not inconsistent with other provisions of this Agreement; or (h) to supply exclusively from the territory of the Party the goods that it produces or the services that it supplies to a specific regional market or to the world market.  2. The provisions of paragraph 1 do not preclude either Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with investment and business activities in its territory of an investor of the other Party or of a non-Party, on compliance with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs 1 (d), (g) and (h).  3. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, provide a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory.  4. Provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or unjustifiable manner, or do not constitute a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in paragraphs 1(b), (c) or (d) shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures, including environmental measures:  
(a) necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement;  (b) necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; or  (c) necessary for the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.  5. Nothing in this Article shall be construed so as to derogate from the rights and obligations of the Parties under the TRIMs Agreement.  6. This Article does not preclude the application of any commitment, obligation or requirement between private parties, where a Party did not impose or require such commitment, undertaking or requirement.   A10.8:SMBD  1. Neither Party may require that an enterprise of that Party that is an investment of an investor of the other Party appoint to senior management positions individuals of any particular nationality.  2. A Party may require that a majority of the board of directors, or any committee thereof, of an enterprise of that Party that is an investment of an investor of the other Party, be of a particular nationality, or resident in the territory of the Party, provided that the requirement does not materially impair the ability of the investor to exercise control over its investment.   A10.9:N-CM  1. Articles 10.4, 10.7, and 10.8 shall not apply to:   (a) any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party as set out in its Schedule to Annex 9A;  (b) the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure referred to in paragraph (a); or   
(c) an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in paragraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment, with Articles 10.4, 10.7, and 10.8.  2. Articles 10.4, 10.7 and 10.8 shall not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with respect to sectors, sub-sectors or activities, as set out in its Schedule to Annex 9B.   3. Neither Party shall, under any measure adopted after the date of entry into force of this Agreement and covered by its Schedule to Annex 9B, require an investor of the other Party, by reason of its nationality, to sell or otherwise dispose of an investment existing at the time the measure becomes effective.  4. Articles 10.4 and 10.8 shall not apply to:   (a) government procurement by a Party; or (b) subsidies or grants provided by a Party, or to any conditions attached to the receipt or continued receipt of such subsidies or grants, whether or not such subsidies or grants are offered exclusively to investors of the Party or investments of investors of the Party, including government-supported loans, guarantees and insurance.  5. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed so as to derogate from rights and obligations under international agreements in respect of protection of intellectual property rights to which both Parties are party, including the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and other treaties concluded under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organization.   A10.10:FL  1. If a Party makes any further liberalisation of the remaining restrictions scheduled in conformity with Article 10.9 by an agreement with a non-Party, it shall afford adequate opportunity to the other Party to negotiate treatment granted therein on a mutually advantageous basis and with a view to securing an overall balance of rights and obligations. 
 2. Through the review mechanism pursuant to Article 22.1, the Parties will engage in further liberalisation with a view to reaching the reduction or elimination of the remaining restrictions scheduled in conformity with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 10.9 on a mutually advantageous basis and securing an overall balance of rights and obligations.   A10.11:T  1. Each Party shall permit all transfers relating to an investment of an investor of the other Party to be made freely and without delay into and out of its territory. Such transfers include:    (a) the initial capital and additional amounts to maintain or increase an investment; (b)  profits, dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management fees, technical assistance and other fees, returns in kind and other amounts derived from the investment;  (c) proceeds from the sale of all or any part of the investment or from the partial or complete liquidation of the investment;  (d) payments made under a contract entered into by the investor, or its investment, including payments made pursuant to a loan agreement;  (e) payments made pursuant to Articles 10.13 and 10.14; and (f) payments arising under Section C.  2. Each Party shall permit transfers prescribed in paragraph 1 to be made in a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing at the time of transfer.  3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, a Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to:   (a) bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors;  (b) issuing, trading, or dealing in securities, futures, options, or derivatives;  (c) financial reporting or record keeping of transfers when necessary to assist law enforcement or financial regulatory authorities; (d) criminal or penal offences; or 
(e) ensuring compliance with orders or judgments in judicial or administrative proceedings.   A10.12:S  1. A Party may, subject to paragraph 2, adopt or maintain measures inconsistent with its obligation provided for in Article 10.4 relating to cross-border capital transactions or Article 10.11:  (a) in the event of serious balance of payments or external financial difficulties or threat thereof; or (b) where, in exceptional circumstances, payments and capital movements between the Parties cause or threaten to cause serious difficulties for the operation of monetary policy or exchange rate policy in either Party.  2. The measures referred to in paragraph 1:  (a) shall be consistent with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund; (b) shall not exceed those necessary to deal with the circumstances described in paragraph 1 ; (c) shall be temporary and phased out progressively as the situation improves; (d) shall promptly be notified to the other Party; (e) shall avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic and financial interests of the other Party;  (f) shall be applied on a national treatment basis; and (g) shall ensure that the other Party is treated as favourably as any non-Party.  3. Measures adopted or maintained pursuant to paragraph 1(b) shall not exceed a period of six (6) months and may be extended through their formal reintroduction. In addition, a Party adopting such measures or any changes shall commence consultations with the other Party in order to review the restrictions adopted by it.  4. Nothing in this Chapter shall be regarded as affecting the rights enjoyed and obligations undertaken by a Party as a party to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. 
A10.13:EC  1. Neither Party may, directly or indirectly, nationalise or expropriate an investment of an investor of the other Party in its territory, except:   (a) for a public purpose;  (b) on a non-discriminatory basis;  (c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 10.6 ; and  (d) on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.  2. Compensation shall:  (a) be paid without delay and be fully realisable; (b) be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place ("date of expropriation"); and (c) not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier.  3. If the fair market value is denominated in a freely usable currency, the compensation paid shall be no less than the fair market value on the date of expropriation, plus interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.   4. If the fair market value is denominated in a currency that is not freely usable, the compensation paid – converted into the currency of payment at the market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment – shall be no less than:  (a) the fair market value on the date of expropriation, converted into a freely usable currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date, plus (b) interest, at a commercially reasonable rate for that freely usable currency, accrued from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.  5. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, any measure of expropriation relating to land, which shall be as defined in the existing domestic legislation of the expropriating Party on the date of entry into force of this Agreement, shall be, for a purpose and upon payment of compensation, in accordance with the aforesaid legislation and any 
subsequent amendments thereto relating to the amount of compensation where such amendments follow the general trends in the market value of the land.  6. This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licences granted in relation to intellectual property rights in accordance with the TRIPS Agreement, or to the revocation, limitation, or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation, or creation is consistent with Chapter 17 (Intellectual Property Rights).   A10.14:LC  1. Investors of a Party whose investments suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection, riot or other similar situations, and such losses as ones resulting from requisition or destruction of property, which was not caused in combat action or was not required by the necessity of the situation, in the territory of the other Party, shall be accorded by the other Party, treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other forms of settlement, no less favourable than that which the other Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any non-Party, whichever is more favourable to the investors concerned.  2. Paragraph 1 does not apply to existing measures relating to subsidies or grants, or to any conditions attached to the receipt or continued receipt of such subsidies or grants, whether or not such subsidies or grants are offered exclusively to investors of the Party or investments of investors of the Party, including government-supported loans, guarantees and insurance, that would be inconsistent with Article 10.4 but for paragraph 4(b) of Article 10.9.   A10.15:S  1. Where a Party or an agency authorised by that Party has granted a contract of insurance or any form of financial guarantee against non-commercial risks with regard to an investment by one of its investors in the territory of the other Party and when                                              Article 10.13 is to be interpreted in accordance with and is subjected to the letter exchange on expropriation. 
payment has been made under this contract or financial guarantee by the former Party or the agency authorised by it, the latter Party shall recognise the rights of the former Party or the agency authorised by the Party by virtue of the principle of subrogation to the rights of the investor.  2. Where a Party or the agency authorised by the Party has made a payment to its investor and has taken over rights and claims of the investor, that investor shall not, unless authorised to act on behalf of the Party or the agency authorised by the Party, making the payment, pursue those rights and claims against the other Party.  3. Articles 10.11, 10.13 and 10.14 shall apply mutatis mutandis as regards payment to be made to the Party or the agency prescribed in paragraphs 1 and 2 by virtue of such recognition of rights and claims, and the transfer of such payment.   A10.16:SFIR  1. Nothing in Article 10.4 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that prescribes special formalities in connection with the establishment of investments by investors of the other Party, such as the requirement that investments be legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, provided that such formalities are consistent with this Chapter and do not materially impair the protections pursuant to this Chapter afforded by a Party to investors of the other Party and investments of investors of the other Party .  2. Notwithstanding Article 10.4, a Party may require an investor of the other Party, or an investment of the investor in its territory, to provide routine information concerning that investment solely for informational or statistical purposes. The Party shall protect such business information that is confidential from any disclosure that would prejudice the competitive position of the investor or the investment. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a Party from otherwise obtaining or disclosing information in connection with the equitable and good faith application of its law.   A10.17:DB  
Subject to prior notification and consultation in accordance with Articles 19.3  and 20.4, a Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the other Party that is an enterprise of such other Party and to investments of that investor if investors of a non-Party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantive business operations in the territory of the other Party under whose law it is constituted or organised.   A10.18:EM  Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental concerns.    SC-SD PIOP  A10.19:SDPIOP   1. This Article shall apply to disputes between a Party and an investor of the other Party concerning an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under this Chapter which causes loss or damage to the investor or its investment and establishes a mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes that assures both equal treatment among investors of the Parties in accordance with the principle of international reciprocity and due process before an impartial tribunal.  2. The parties to the dispute shall initially seek to resolve the dispute by consultations and negotiations.   3. If the dispute cannot be resolved as provided for under paragraph 2 within six (6) months from the date of a request for consultations and negotiations, and if the investor concerned has not submitted the investment dispute for resolution (a) before the courts or administrative tribunals of the disputing Party (excluding proceedings for interim 
measures of protection referred to in paragraph 5), or (b) in accordance with any previously agreed dispute settlement procedures, the investor concerned may submit the dispute for settlement to:   (a) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), if both Parties are parties to the ICSID Convention; (b) arbitration under UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or (c) any other arbitral institution or in accordance with any other arbitral rules, if the parties to the dispute so agree.  4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of a dispute to arbitration under paragraphs 3(a) and 3(b) in accordance with the provisions of this Article, conditional upon:   (a) the submission of the dispute to such arbitration taking place within three (3) years of the time at which the disputing investor became aware, or should reasonably have become aware, of a breach of an obligation under this Chapter and, of the loss or damage incurred by the disputing investor or its investment; (b) the disputing investor not being an enterprise of the disputing Party until the disputing investor refers the dispute for arbitration pursuant to paragraph 3; and (c) the disputing investor providing written notice, which shall be delivered at least ninety (90) days before the claim to arbitration is submitted, to the disputing Party of its intent to submit the dispute to such arbitration and which: (i) nominates one (1) of the fora in paragraph 3(a), (b) or (c) as the forum for dispute settlement;  (ii) briefly summarises the alleged breach of the disputing Party under this Chapter (including the articles alleged to have been breached) and the loss or damage allegedly caused to the investor or its investment.  5. Neither Party shall prevent the disputing investor from seeking interim measures of protection, not involving the payment of damages or resolution of the substance of the matter in dispute before the courts or administrative tribunals of the disputing Party, prior to the institution of proceedings before any of the dispute settlement fora referred to in paragraph 3, for the preservation of its rights and interests.  
 6. Neither Party shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its investors and the other Party shall have consented to submit or have submitted to arbitration under this Article, unless such other Party has failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such dispute.  Diplomatic protection, for the purposes of this paragraph, shall not include informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating a settlement of the dispute.

A13.2:GP  1. Further to Article 1.2, this Chapter reflects the preferential trading relationship between the Parties, the Parties’ mutual desire to facilitate temporary entry on a comparable basis and to establish transparent criteria and procedures for temporary entry, and the need to ensure border security and to protect the domestic labour force and permanent employment in their respective territories.  2.    This Chapter shall not apply to measures regarding nationality or citizenship, residence on a permanent basis or employment on a permanent basis.     A13.3:GO   1. Each Party shall apply its measures relating to the provisions of this Chapter in accordance with Article 13.2 and, in particular, shall apply expeditiously those measures 
so as to avoid unduly impairing or delaying trade in goods or services or conduct of investment activities under this Agreement.  2. The Parties shall endeavour to develop and adopt common definitions and interpretations for the implementation of this Chapter.   3. Nothing in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of business persons into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of its borders, and to ensure the orderly movement of business persons across its borders, provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the commitments made by a Party.  The mere requirement of a visa or other document authorising employment shall not be regarded as nullifying or impairing the commitments made by a Party under this Agreement.   A13.4:GTE  1. In accordance with this Chapter and subject to the provisions of Annex 13A and Appendix 13A.1, each Party shall grant temporary entry to business persons who are otherwise qualified for entry under applicable measures relating to public health, safety and national security.  2.

A13.6:DS  1. A Party may not initiate proceedings under Article 20.6 regarding a refusal to grant temporary entry under this Chapter or a particular case arising under Article 13.2 unless:   (a) the matter involves a pattern of practice; and  (b) the business person has exhausted the available administrative remedies regarding the particular matter.  2. The remedies referred to in paragraph 1(b) shall be deemed to be exhausted if a final determination in the matter has not been issued by the competent authority within six (6) months of the institution of an administrative proceeding, and the failure to issue a determination is not attributable to delay caused by the business person.   A13.7:ROC   Except for this Chapter, Chapters 1(General Provisions), 2(General Definitions), 20(Dispute Settlement) and 22(Administration and Final Provisions), and Articles 19.2,

A15.4:CN  1. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to ensure that its government does not provide any competitive advantage to any government-owned businesses in their business activities simply because they are government-owned.   2. This Article applies to the business activities of government-owned businesses and not to their non-business and non-commercial activities.   A15.5:C  1.

The arbitral panel may, after consulting the Parties, adopt additional rules of procedure not inconsistent with the model rules.   A20.10:ITA  1.  Upon request of a Party, or on its own initiative, the arbitral panel may seek information and technical advice from any person or body that it deems appropriate. Any information and technical advice so obtained shall be made available to the Parties.  2.  With respect to factual issues concerning a scientific or other technical matter raised by a Party, the arbitral panel may request advisory reports in writing from an expert or experts. The arbitral panel may, at the request of a Party or on its own 
initiative, select, in consultation with the Parties, scientific or technical experts who shall assist the arbitral panel throughout its proceedings, but who shall not have the right to vote in respect of any decision to be made by the arbitral panel.   A20.11:IR  1.  Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the arbitral panel shall base its report on the relevant provisions of this Agreement, on the submissions and arguments of the Parties, and on any information before it, pursuant to Article 20.10.   2.  Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the arbitral panel shall, within ninety (90) days after the last member is selected, present to the Parties an initial report containing:   (a)  findings of law and/or fact together with reasons; (b)  its determination as to the implementation, interpretation or application of this Agreement or whether the measure at issue is inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement or causes nullification or impairment of any benefit accruing to a Party under this Agreement, or any other determination requested in the terms of reference; and  (c)  its recommendations, if any, on the means to resolve the dispute.  3.  The Parties may submit written comments on the initial report within fourteen (14) days of its presentation.   4.  In case that such written comments by the Parties are received as provided for in paragraph 3, the arbitral panel, on its own initiative or at the request of a Party, may reconsider its report and make any further examination that it considers appropriate after considering such written comments.   A20.12:FR  1.  The arbitral panel shall present a final report to the Parties, within thirty (30) days of presentation of the initial report, unless the Parties otherwise agree.   2.  The final report of the arbitral panel shall be made publicly available within fifteen 
(15) days of its delivery to the Parties.   A20.13:IFR  1.  The final report of an arbitral panel shall be binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to appeal.  2.  On receipt of the final report of an arbitral panel, the Parties shall agree on:  (a)  the means to resolve the dispute, which normally shall conform with the determinations or recommendations, if any, of the arbitral panel; and (b)  the reasonable period of time which is necessary in order to implement the means to resolve the dispute. If the Parties fail to agree on the reasonable period of time, a Party may request the original arbitral panel to determine the length of the reasonable period of time, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. The determination of the arbitral panel shall be presented within fifteen (15) days from that request.   3.  If, in its final report, the arbitral panel determines that a Party has not conformed with its obligations under this Agreement or that a Party’s measure has caused nullification or impairment, the means to resolve the dispute shall, whenever possible, be to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.   A20.14:N-I–CSB  1.  If the Parties  (a) are unable to agree on the means to resolve the dispute pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of Article 20.13 within thirty (30) days of issuance of the final report; or (b)  have agreed on the means to resolve the dispute pursuant to Article 20.13 and the Party complained against fails to implement the aforesaid means within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the reasonable period of time determined in accordance with paragraph 2(b) of Article 20.13,   
the Party complained against shall enter into negotiations with the complaining Party with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement on any necessary compensatory adjustment.    2.  If no mutually satisfactory agreement on compensation has been reached within twenty (20) days after the Parties have entered into negotiations on compensatory adjustment, the complaining Party may at any time thereafter provide written notice to the Party complained against that it intends to suspend the application to that Party of benefits of equivalent effect.  The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the complaining Party proposes to suspend. The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits thirty (30) days after the date when it provides notice to the Party complained against under this paragraph, or the date when the arbitral panel issues the report under paragraph 6, whichever is later.  3.  Any suspension of benefits shall be restricted to benefits granted to the Party complained against under this Agreement.    4.  In considering what benefits to suspend under paragraph 2:   (a)  the complaining Party should first seek to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors as that affected by the measure or other matter that the arbitral panel has found to be inconsistent with this Agreement or to have caused nullification or impairment; and  (b)  the complaining Party may suspend  benefits  in other sectors if it considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same sector.    5.  The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall only be applied until such time as the measure found to be inconsistent with this Agreement, or to have caused nullification or impairment has been removed, or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.  6.  If the Party complained against considers that:   (a)  the level of benefits that the complaining Party has proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive; or  (b)  it has eliminated the non-conformity, nullification or impairment that the 
arbitral panel has found,  it may request the original arbitral panel to determine the matter. The original arbitral panel shall present its determination to the Parties within thirty (30) days after it reconvenes.  7.  If the arbitral panel cannot be reconvened with its original members, the procedures for appointment for the arbitral panel set out in Article 20.7 shall be applied.   A20.15:OL  1.  All proceedings and all documents submitted to the arbitral panel shall be in the English language.  2.  When an original document submitted to the arbitral panel by a Party is not in the English language, that Party shall translate it into the English language and submit it with the original document at the same time.   A20.16:E  1.  Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the costs of the arbitral panel and other expenses associated with the conduct of its proceedings shall be borne in equal parts by both Parties.  2.  Each Party shall bear its own expenses and legal costs in the arbitral proceedings.

CHAPTER 21 EXCEPTIONS   A21.1:D  For the purposes of this Chapter:   
tax agreement means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or other international agreement or arrangement.    A21.2:GE  1. Article XX of GATT is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, for the purposes of:   (a) Chapters 3 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods), 4 (Rules of Origin), 5 (Customs Procedures), 6 (Trade Remedies), and 14 (Electronic Commerce), except to the extent that a provision of those Chapters applies to services or investment; and (b)  Chapter 16 (Government Procurement), except to the extent that any of its provisions applies to services.  2.  Subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Article XIV of GATS are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, for the purposes of:   (a)  Chapters 3 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods), 4 (Rules of Origin), 5 (Customs Procedures), 6 (Trade Remedies), and 14 (Electronic Commerce), to the extent that a provision of those chapters applies to services; (b)  Chapter 9 (Cross Border Trade in Services); (c)  Chapter 10 (Investment); (d)  Chapters 11 (Telecommunication) and 12 (Financial Services); and (e)  Chapter 16 (Government Procurement), to the extent that a provision applies to services.   A21.3:NS  1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed:   (a) to require a Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or   
(b) to prevent a Party from taking any actions which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests:   (i)  relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of  war and to such traffic in other goods and materials or relating to the supply of services as carried on, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of supplying or provisioning a military establishment;   (ii)  taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations;   (iii) relating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials from which they are derived; or  (c)  to prevent a Party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.  A Party shall inform the other Party to the fullest extent possible, of measures taken under paragraphs 1(b) and (c) and of their termination during the meeting to review the implementation of this Agreement under Article 22.1, if such measures were taken.   A21.4:T  1. Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation measures.  2. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of either Party under any tax agreement to which both Parties are parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and any such agreement, that agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. In the case of a bilateral tax agreement between the Parties, the competent authorities under that agreement shall have sole responsibility for determining whether any inconsistency exists between this Agreement and that agreement.   3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, Article 3.3 and such other provisions of this Agreement as are necessary to give effect to that Article shall apply to taxation 
measures to the same extent as does Article III of GATT 1994.  4. Articles 10.13 and 10.19 shall apply to taxation measures to the extent that such taxation measures constitute expropriation as provided for therein. An investor that seeks to invoke Article 10.13 with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the competent authorities described in paragraph 5, at the time that it gives notice under Article 10.19, the issue of whether that taxation measure involves an expropriation. If the competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six (6) months of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 10.19.  5. For the purposes of this Article, competent authorities means:  (a)  for Singapore, Director for Fiscal Policy, Ministry of Finance, or his successor or such other public officer as may be designated by Singapore; and  (b) for Korea, Deputy Minister, Tax and Customs Office, Ministry of Finance and Economy or his successor.                                                With reference to Article 10.13 in assessing whether a taxation measure constitutes expropriation, the following considerations are relevant: (i) the imposition of taxes does not generally constitute expropriation. The mere introduction of new taxation measures or the imposition of taxes in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment, does not in and of itself constitute expropriation; (ii) taxation measures which are consistent with internationally recognised tax policies, principles and practices do not constitute expropriation. In particular, taxation measures aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes should not, generally, be considered to be expropriatory; and (iii) taxation measures which are applied on a non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to being targeted at investors of a particular nationality or specific individual taxpayers, are less likely to constitute expropriation. A taxation measure should not constitute expropriation if, when the investment is made, it was already in force, and information about the measure was made public or otherwise made publicly available.
